🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project implements an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to predict the price of a car based on multiple technical and performance-related features. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation using real-world data.

📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates car prices using historical data. This helps understand how various factors like engine size, horsepower, mileage, and weight affect car pricing.

📂 Dataset
